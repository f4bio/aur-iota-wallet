iota-wallet (AUR package)
=========================

* v2.3.1
* https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet

Not published to AUR yet.  
Although I think `perl-rename` should be preferred over the "normal" `rename` tool in Arch/Linux anyways, I don't think its a good idea to depend on `perl-rename` just for building a (this) package. But I haven't found the correct glob syntax to rename the folder yet (like I did with regex)
